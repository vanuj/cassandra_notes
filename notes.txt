C* one liners
---------------------
C* Read before write.

C* dosent read before write, and thats why it is fast. 

NTP : Network time protocol
-C* never operates on n/w time, it uses NTP

-C* is called P2P(peer to peer system)

-Hashmap reads before write, C* doesnt.
-C* is a data store.
-C* is masterless architecture
-C* driver auto setsup and discover all the nodes during init(nodes-ip address) 
-C* driver drives the nodes

Seed Notes:
-C* a node registers   itself and start registering others, and starts seeding, using common lang TCP, and gossip
-C* decomission, remove, assasinate
-C* gossip : random(3 nodes) info sharing based on timestamp info about nodes down(heartbeat) and other(ip) information
-C* gossip and handshaking is different. (no need to get useful info back in return of a valuable info, inform of acknowledgement).


-C* : when node is added, it recalculates the ROL and distributes the ranges among peer nodes.
	And then data is distributed/copied after waiting of 30seconds.
	User copy the data clockwise in cassandra.
	how many rings are possible in cassandra  ?
-C* 2 nodes , replication factor is 3, it stops after 
-C* system.local and system.peers in each node. Token range is maintained

-C* Snitch : topology aware and avoid replicating data in same rack and same technology.
	node add, remove, key space change, made a change in snitch(java class) to recalculate 

Deployments - 4 Dimensions
node->racks->ring/datacenter(same)->cluster

SEDA Architecture

Cassandra Query Language (CQL), is a playload kind of things.
Cassandra is QDD Query Driven Design


Code : 
Have pythons
Have Java
Have Cassandra

cassandra.yaml
	cluster_name
	hints_directory
	authenticator
	authorizer
	partitioner
	data_file_directories:
	commitlog_directory
	saved_caches_directory
	seed_provider
	disk_optimization_strategy  //from ssd to spinning
	listen_address: localhost
	endpoint_snitch: GossipingPropertyFileSnitch

ssd : increase performance if we play with it. solid state disks

modify cassandra-rackdc.properties
dc=dc1
rack=rack1 to r1

cassandra.bat

in new cmd : 
cassandra bin : go to nodetool.bat status

in new cmd : 
cqlsh.bat -u cassandra

CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS stockdb WITH replication = {'class':'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1' : 1};

CREATE TABLE stockdb.user11 (
  user_id VARCHAR,
  display_name VARCHAR,
  first_name VARCHAR,
  last_name VARCHAR,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);

insert into stockdb.user11 (user_id, display_name, first_name, last_name) values ('u1', 'NM2', 'Anuj', 'Verma' );

update stockdb.user set display_name = 'NM-100', first_name = 'Nirmallya' where user_id = 'u2';

insert into stockdb.user(user_id, last_name) values ('u2', 'Mukherjee22');

delete from stockdb.user where user_id = 'u200';

var\lib\cassandra\data : go and check stockdb

nodetool.bat describering stockdb > stockdb.txt (created in bin folder and file name as stockdb)

describe keyspaces
 
describe keyspace stockdb

describe tables

describe table stockdb.user11

In any table : primary key and partition key are mandatory; partition key + clustering cols will give us primary key.
PRIMARY KEY (meter_id, date), created_hh, created_min)
By default first is taken as the primary key

DATA MODEL DESIGN ADN LOGIC
-----------------------------------------
- Cassandra Query Language (CQL), is a playload kind of things.
Cassandra is QDD Query Driven Design
- Sec Index not a good solution in C* thing something else
- Should solve fast performance data and quick with logical design that will give us the desired data(not the any data)
- Not good for analytics OLAP.(C* + Spark db will give bith support, spark is master slave)
- DATA format in node 
	Partition key : c1c2 data : c1c2 data : c1c2 data
	
	cc clustering columns
- NEVER have unbounded values for declaring/naming clustering columns
	E.g. no varchar, because they are used in column identifier keys
- Assume 
	Node gets inert and update,
	It save data model in Binary tree format
	It save and maintains key(primary, cc , columns) in key valus pair in a row
	Hence if any update comes, it know the Binary tree address and adds it to the tree
	Hence we can update or delete any column identified and maintains an in-memory tree.
	It transfers the in-mrmory BTree data to db file.
	It keeps on putting these.

2.x => 3.x improves efficiency from 4 times.
By changing it into byte buffer, the overlapping main cluster with 10:01

Previously it used to shoe the inmemory and processing things 
on cassandra cli, now they have moved it to ssTable dumps.


Consistency Level (CL)
For how long should the driver wait..? to get ackn?
Developer himself sets the consistency Level

tracing on;

Read/Repair
DC local read repair chance, or DC read/repair chance

hinted folder
consistence level >1 will kik in the blocking read repair.
consistency = 1, chance will decide if read repair is to be triggered and if triggered it would be non blocking
nodetool repair : all nodes, partition, data checks, all nodes;

Window
	End java process via task manager
	go to var lib data and see 8 files generated

	Now insert one more data to cassandra(please start it once)
	and type : nodetool.bat flush
	Observe.. files go replicated in the folder.

	Create folder flush at same level
	nodetool.bat flush
	nodetool.bat refresh stockdb user11

	creating snapshot
	nodetool.bat snapshot

	delete a record
		delete last_name from stockdb.user11 where user_id = 'u1';
		select * from stockdb.user11;

		nodetool.bat compact

		nodetool.bat getsstables stockdb user11 u1; // will give path to some data 
		copy that path and 
		go to tool\bin and fire sstabledump.bat -d C:\var\lib\cassandra\data\stockdb\user11-bcd3ded06bd411e78c47cd5a8b8f9c86\mc-9-big-Data.db
		check tombstone

		

TTL
-----------------
update stockdb.user11 using ttl 30 set last_name = 'verma' where user_id ='u2';
useful in TOP, email renew, passowrd retrieve

Other Query 
---------------------------
 IN query risky in some cases:
 	select * from stockdb.user11 where user_id in ('u1', 'u3');
  
  
select * from stockdb.user11 where last_name='ada'; Error 
select * from stockdb.user11 where last_name='ada'ALLOW FILTERING ;
since internally it will do select * from, hence dont use ALLOW FILTERING
ALLOW FILTERING is based on Linear scan
Secondary Index uses Binary Tree scan
